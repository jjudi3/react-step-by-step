  // user moves mouse, clicks on element, types in input
  // when user types we want to know that they typed and what they typed
  // 1. declare event handler. An event handler is a function that should run when ever an event occurs.
  // 2. pass the event handler to the element that we want to monitor for Events
  // so lets look at a normal input element...what happens...the text is changing. We want to
    // create an event handler to run a function everytime the text changes
    //let's create that event handler...a method...onInputChnange
    // naming convention "handle" or "on" then "element"  then name of the event itself
    // after creating the event handler, pass it to the element you want to effect
  // all HTML input elements emit a change event when a user interacts with them. JS thing.
  // property onChange = { } then the name of the event handler.
  // now, let's go back to the event handler. onInputChange
  // pass to it an argument "(event)". Name anything :) event item describes the context or information that occurred.
  // use event to get access to the value. Console log it. to get value event.target.value
  // event handlers often called with event object to get more information about the event that just occurred.
